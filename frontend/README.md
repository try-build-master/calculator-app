# Frontend (React + Vite)

Welcome to the frontend of the **Calculator App**! ðŸŽ‰  
In this section, you will build the UI using **React** and **Vite**, allowing the user to input numbers and perform calculations.

---

## ðŸ›  Structure
- **`src/App.jsx`**: Main React component where youâ€™ll build the UI for input and result display.
- **`src/main.jsx`**: Entry point for the React app, rendering `App.jsx`.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Vite configuration file for building the app.

---

## ðŸš€ Tasks

### 1. `frontend-basic`
- Create a form with two **inputs** for numbers and a **select dropdown** for the operator.
- Add a **submit button** but donâ€™t handle the event just yet.

### 2. `frontend-api-call`
- Implement the logic to send the form data to the backend API using `fetch` or `axios`.
- On form submission, send a **POST request** to `/calculate` with the numbers and operator.

### 3. `frontend-ui-polish`
- Style the frontend using **CSS** (you can use plain CSS, or libraries like **Tailwind**).
- Make the layout look clean and simple for better user experience.
